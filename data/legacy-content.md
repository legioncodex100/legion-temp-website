## Kids Free Trial: Building a Foundation for Life

### 1. Hero Section

**Main Headline:** Give Your Child the Legion Advantage.

**Sub-headline:** More than martial arts—we teach resilience, coordination, and grit. Book a free trial for your child and see why East London parents trust our structured 12-grade youth roadmap.

### 2. The Legion Method for Kids

We believe grappling is the ultimate vehicle for physical and mental development. Our program is designed to build resilience through three core pillars:

- **Physical Literacy:** Developing the balance, flexibility, and coordination that serves as a foundation for every sport they will ever play.
- **Emotional Resilience:** Learning how to fall safely, stay calm under pressure, and get back up with confidence.
- **Structured Progress:** Children earn their awards through consistency and technical mastery across our curriculums.

### 6. FAQs for Parents

**"Is it safe for my child?"**
Safety is our #1 priority. We focus on "Ukemi" (the art of falling) and technical control before any live wrestling begins.

**"Do I need separate trial items for a son and a daughter?"**
No. The "Kids Free Trial" is a universal credit. Add it to each child's profile during signup. When booking, remember to use "Switch Account" to select each child before choosing their class.

**"Can I watch the class?"**
Yes. We have a designated viewing area for mothers and female guardians for girls-only classes, and a general viewing area for all other youth sessions.

**"How do I buy more classes for my kids?"**
You can either buy directly from the Pricing Page or log into your Member Portal and top up in the shop. Both options are 100% automated.
