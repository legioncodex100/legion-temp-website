# About Us

Legion Grappling Academy is a high-level grappling academy that provides instruction in Wrestling, Jiu-Jitsu, and Nogi Grappling. We have classes for men, women and kids of all levels. Our unique approach to teaching grapplers of all levels has made us stand out from the competition since day one. Legion was born out of a love for this sport and it shows in each class we teach!

As an Academy, we are focused on providing high-level coaching by developing curriculums for Jiu-Jitsu and Wrestling.

We aim to do this by:

- Develop curriculums for both Jiu-Jitsu and Wrestling
- Develop coaching and competition pathways
