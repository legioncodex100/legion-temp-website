# How to Sign Up Your Child for a Free Trial: A Step-by-Step Parent Guide

At **Legion Grappling Academy**, we use a "Family Account" system powered by **Mindbody**. This allows you, the parent, to manage everything—bookings, payments, and waivers—for all your children from a single login.

Follow this simple guide to get started.

## Step 1: Start Registration
Click the **"Start Family Trial"** button on our website, or navigate directly to our [Sign Up Page](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=137536).

You will see a screen like this. Look for the **"Create account"** box.

## Step 2: Use YOUR Details First
In the "Create Account" box, enter **YOUR email address** (the parent's email).

> **Important:** Do NOT create a separate account for your child yet. You are creating the "Head of Household" account first.

## Step 3: Create Your Family Profile
Fill in your details. You will see a header that says **"Create a Mindbody family account"**. This confirms you are in the right place!

This account will be the "Master Key" for your family. You will use this login for everything.
